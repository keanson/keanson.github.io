I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in Statistics at Renmin University of China. Here are my [CV](https://keanson.github.io/files/CV.pdf) and [Publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lqS0vk4AAAAJ)

My research interest spreads across machine learning, including learning theory, gaussian process, and statistical learning.
