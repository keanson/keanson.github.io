I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Statistics at Renmin University of China, and I anticipate obtaining my Bachelor's Degree during the course of 2024. Here are my [CV](https://keanson.github.io/files/CV.pdf) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lqS0vk4AAAAJ).

My research interest lies in the intersection of statistics and computer science, focusing on giving statistical analyses of modern learning methods. My research topics include machine learning theory, Bayesian statistics, reinforcement learning, and AI4Science.

I am a big cinephile and my favorite film of all time is [The Lighthouse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7984734/).
