I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in Statistics at Renmin University of China. Here are my [CV](https://keanson.github.io/files/CV.pdf) and [Publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lqS0vk4AAAAJ).

My research interest lies in the intersection of statistics and computer science, focusing on machine learning theory, Bayesian statistics, and reinforcement learning.

I am a big cinephile and my favorite film of all time is [The Lighthouse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7984734/).
